# Code style

## General

- Avoid comments unless referencing an external bug or workaround
- Avoid premature optimisation - YAGNI
- Simple, direct code is easier to fix, test, and understand. Excess options create "dead code" or
  "configuration hell" that slows down development.
- Keep the scaffold minimal until product requirements force new dependencies.

## Formatting and Linting

- If lint or typescript exception is required, comment or link to upstream issue/docs.
- Use Oxfmt for formatting; run `pnpm format` when needed
- Suggest adding or changing Oxlint rules where appropriate

## TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all source; avoid `any` unless no alternative
- Minimal typing: Prefer inference and structural typing; add explicit types only when they improve
  correctness or readability. Don’t use as (or extra type aliases) to silence errors; fix the source
  type instead.
- Use existing exported library/parser types instead of ad-hoc local type shapes.
- Use inline parameter typing (including discriminated unions).
- Avoid separate 'type' statements unless intentionally shared or exported

## React

- Usually react hooks and related logic should be encapsulated in a custom hook
- For UI primitives, prefer `@tohuhono/ui` components when an equivalent primitive exists. Only
  reach for local shadcn/Base UI primitives when `@tohuhono/ui` does not provide the needed
  component.

## Tanstack

- Use file-based routing under `src/routes`.
- Prefer TanStack Start server functions for server-only mutations and secret-bearing reads.
- Treat route loaders as isomorphic unless a TanStack skill explicitly documents a safer pattern.

## Validation

Shell-Validation Pattern: Zod at the gates, Types in the streets.

- Validate with Zod; infer types;
- Parse, Don't Just Validate.
- Fail Early and Loudly.
- Avoid runtime validation checks in internal business logic to maximize performance and minimize
  code clutter; favour improving static checking;
